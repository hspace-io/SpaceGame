[MEMO]
Your mission is to activate debug mode by performing voltage glitching on the target.
This is a mission to check if you know how to use ChipWhisperer. 

Additionally.. I recommend you to do glitching using the crowbar port. 
You can assume that ChipWhisper's GND and Trezor's GND are connected.
